# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for this project
include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting the project maintainers at misterunix@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is
deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be
temporarily or permanently removed from the project at the discretion of the
project owners.

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an
individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a
project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online
or offline event. Representation may be further defined and clarified by project
maintainers.

Enforcement Guidelines

1. Report: If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the
   maintainers at misterunix@gmail.com with as much detail as possible.
2. Acknowledge: The maintainers will acknowledge receipt of a report within a
   reasonable timeframe.
3. Investigate: The maintainers will investigate and determine appropriate action.
4. Actions: Possible actions include a warning, temporary removal from project
   spaces, or permanent banning from project spaces.
