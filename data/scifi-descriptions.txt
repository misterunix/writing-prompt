A starfield like scattered ice across black glass
Silent vacuum swallowing every sound
Light bending around unseen gravity
A sun burning cold blue instead of gold
Nebula clouds glowing like bruised fire
Darkness so deep it feels physical
Constellations warped by relativistic speed
Starlight arriving centuries too late
A horizon made of endless night
Galaxies drifting like distant embers
Metal corridors humming with hidden power
Consoles blinking in anxious patterns
Screens casting sterile white light
Wiring bundled like exposed nerves
Engines vibrating through the floor
Air recycled until it tastes thin
Cold alloy smooth as bone
Doors sealing with airtight finality
Circuits glowing faint beneath glass
Machines breathing in steady rhythms
Geometry that hurts to look at
Colors without human names
Movement too fluid to follow
Skin like translucent crystal
Voices layered in impossible harmonies
Eyes reflecting unfamiliar stars
Symbols that feel older than language
Silence that seems aware
Structures grown instead of built
Presence felt before it is seen
Dust floating in weightless sunlight
Empty cities echoing with wind
Rust spreading like slow disease
Broken satellites frozen in orbit
Footprints preserved for centuries
Lights still burning with no one alive
Walls scorched by forgotten war
Skeletons inside sealed suits
Time stalled in abandoned rooms
Decay drifting without gravity
Neon bleeding across wet pavement
Towers vanishing into smog
Advertisements speaking directly to passersby
Crowds moving in silent coordination
Drones hovering like patient insects
Streets layered above older streets
Windows glowing in endless grids
Surveillance lenses hidden everywhere
Luxury beside visible poverty
Night brighter than day
Sand stretching beyond the curve of sight
Ice plains cracking like thunder
Oceans black under unfamiliar moons
Forests whispering without wind
Mountains sharp as broken glass
Storms circling the entire planet
Gravity pulling just slightly wrong
Skies tinted strange colors
Ground warm with buried heat
Horizons crowded with alien shapes
Loneliness wide as space itself
Hope flickering but unextinguished
Fear carried in quiet breathing
Time feeling stretched thin
Memory blurring at the edges
Awe mixed with dread
Small lives against infinite distance
Silence heavier than sound
Wonder sharpened by danger
Survival that feels temporary
